# Deployment Summary for the `app` Folder

## Overview

The `app` folder contains all source code for the Tripin solution, including server and client components. Deployment involves preparing the application for production and moving the built artifacts to the target environment.

## Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in the relevant subfolders (e.g., `app/server`, `app/client`).

2. **Build the Application**
   - For TypeScript/React or similar projects, run the build command (e.g., `npm run build`) in each subfolder as needed.
   - This generates production-ready files (e.g., in `build/` or `dist/` directories).

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy or set up the `.env` files with production values in the appropriate locations (e.g., `app/server/.env`).

4. **Start the Server**
   - Use a process manager (e.g., `pm2`, `forever`, or systemd) to run the server, typically with `npm start` or `node dist/index.js`.

5. **Serve the Client**
   - If the client is a static site, serve the built files using a static file server or configure the backend to serve them.

6. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Monitor logs and application health using your preferred tools.

## Notes

- All source files remain in the `app` folder; no Markdown or documentation files are included in the deployment artifacts.
- Ensure secrets and API keys are not committed to source control and are securely managed in the deployment environment.
